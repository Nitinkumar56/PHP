 <h2>Allergy Types</h2>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:17px;"><b>Learn the types of allergies including food allergies, seasonal allergies and many more.</b></p>
 
 <h2>Food Allergies</h2>
<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>1.Food Allergies and Food Intolerance:</b></p>

 
 
  <p style="font-size:17px;">Food allergies or food intolerances affect nearly everyone at some point. People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and wonder if they have a food allergy.</p><br />

   <p style="font-size:17px;"><b>2.Milk Allergy:</b></p>

  <p style="font-size:17px;"> If you suffer from a milk allergy, strictly avoiding milk and food containing milk and milk products is the only way to prevent a reaction, which can include immediate wheezing, vomiting, and hives.</p><br />

  
  

 <p  style="font-size:17px;"><b>3.Egg Allergy:</b></p>

 <p  style="font-size:17px">Egg allergies -- especially to egg whites -- are more common in children than in adults and reactions range from mild to severe.</p><br />


<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>4.Wheat Allergy:</b></p>


<p style="font-size:17px">If you are allergic to any wheat protein strictly avoiding wheat and wheat products is the only way to prevent a reaction, which can include stomach upset, eczema, allergic rhinitis, bronchospasm (asthma-like symptoms) and even anaphylaxis.</p><br />


<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>5.Nut (Peanut) Allergy:</b></p>



<p style="font-size:17px">If you suffer from a nut allergy, strictly avoiding nuts, including peanuts and tree nuts like cashews and walnuts, and food containing nuts is the only way to prevent a reaction.</p><br />
  

   
<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>6.Soy Allergy:</b></p>


<p style="font-size:17px">Soy allergies start with soybeans. Soybeans are legumes. Other foods in the legume family include navy beans, kidney beans, string beans, black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo or chichi beans), lentils, carob, licorice, and peanuts.</p><br />

<h2>Seasonal Allergies</h2>

<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>1.Spring Allergies:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:17px">Spring is the time of year that we normally think of when it comes to seasonal allergies. As the trees start to bloom and the pollen gets airborne, allergy sufferers begin their annual ritual of sniffling and sneezing.</p> <br />



<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>2.Summer Allergies:</b></p>
<p style="font-size:17px">Although spring most readily comes to mind when we think of allergies, many of the same allergic triggers that can make us miserable in the spring persist into summer.</p><br />



<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>3.Fall Allergies:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:17px">The allergy triggers might be slightly different, but they can be just as misery-inducing as the flower pollen that fills the air in the spring and summer.</p><br />



<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>4.Winter Allergies:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:17px">Here are some common causes of winter allergies, and a few tips for managing your symptoms.</p><br />

<h2>Other Allergies</h2>

<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>1.Drug Allergy:</b></p>

<p  style="font-size:17px">Many drugs can cause adverse side effects, and certain medicines can trigger allergic reactions. In an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly responds to a drug by creating an immune response against it.</p><br />



<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>2.Dust Allergy:</b></p>

<p  style="font-size:17px">Life with dust allergies -- whether they're yours or a family member's -- comes with a load of questions. For instance, might a dust allergy explain your child's never-ending cold symptoms?</p><br />




<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>3.Chemical Allergy</b></p>


<p  style="font-size:17px">They promise to make your skin soft, your hair shiny, and your laundry springtime fresh, but for some people the chemicals in shampoos, cosmetics, and detergents trigger allergic skin reactions.</p>
