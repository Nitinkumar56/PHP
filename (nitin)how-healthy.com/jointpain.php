 <h2>Joint Pain</h2>

<p style="font-size:17px;">Joints form the connections between bones. They provide support and help you move. Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause a lot of pain.</p>
 
<p style="font-size:17px;">Many different conditions can lead to painful joints, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, gout, strains, sprains, and other injuries. Joint pain is extremely common. In one national survey, about one-third of adults reported having joint pain within the past 30 days. Knee pain was the most common complaint, followed by shoulder and hip pain, but joint pain can affect any part of your body, from your ankles to your shoulders. As you get older, painful joints become increasingly more common.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;">Joint pain can range from mildly irritating to debilitating. It may go away after a few weeks (acute), or last for several weeks or months (chronic). Even short-term pain and swelling in the joints can affect your quality of life. Whatever the cause of joint pain, you can usually manage it with medication, physical therapy, or alternative treatments.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;">Your doctor will first try to diagnose and treat the condition that is causing your joint pain. The goal is to reduce pain and inflammation, and preserve joint function. Treatment options include:</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>Medications</b></p>


<p style="font-size:17px;">For moderate-to-severe joint pain with swelling, an over-the-counter or prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen sodium (Aleve), can provide relief. A newer generation of NSAIDs known as Cox-2 inhibitors (Celebrex) is also good for pain relief, but all except one of these drugs (Celebrex) have been removed from the market because of an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular events. NSAIDs also can have side effects, potentially increasing your risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>


<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>Other drugs that may help relieve pain include:</b></p>

<nav style="font-size:17px;">
<p>Muscle relaxants to treat muscle spasms (may be used together with NSAIDs to increase the effect)</p>
<p>Some  antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs (which both interfere with pain signals)</p></nav>

<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>Injections</b></p>

<p style="font-size:17px;">For people who don't find joint pain relief from oral or topical medications, the doctor can inject a steroid medication (which may be combined with a local anesthetic) directly into the joint every three months to four months. Steroid injections are most commonly used in patients with arthritis, joint disease, or inflammation. Research still has not confirmed whether this procedure is effective, and it can have side effects; if steroid injections mask an injury, you could overuse the joint and damage it even further.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;"><b>Other injection options include:</b></p>

<nav style="font-size:17px;">
 <p>Removing fluid from the joint (and is often done in connection with a steroid injection)</p>
 
<p>Injections of hyaluronan, a synthetic version of the natural joint fluid. This is used to treat osteoarthritis</p></nav>


<p  style="font-size:17px;"><b>Physical Therapy</b></p>


<p style="font-size:17px;">You can work with a physical therapist to strengthen the muscles around the joint, stabilize the joint, and improve your range of motion. The therapist will use techniques such as ultrasound, heat or cold therapy, electrical nerve stimulation, and manipulation.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;">If you are overweight, losing weight can relieve some of the pressure on your painful joints. Exercise is one effective way to lose weight (along with diet), but be careful to stick with low-impact exercises that won't further irritate the joint. Swimming and bicycling are among the best exercises because both allow you to exercise your joints without putting impact on them. Because water is buoyant, swimming also relieves some of the pressure on your joints</p>
